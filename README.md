# PCSX-Reloaded - A PlayStation Emulator
PCSX-Reloaded is a forked version of the dead PCSX emulator, with a nicer
interface and several improvements to stability and functionality.

PCSX-Reloaded uses the PSEMU plugin interface to provide most functionality.
A number of plugins are provided out of the box.

PCSX-Reloaded has a very capable Internal HLE BIOS that can run many games.
However, if you own a real PlayStation, you are able to use your own BIOS image.
PCSX-Reloaded will find it in '~/.pcsx/bios/' or '/usr/share/psemu/bios/' if you
place it there. Using a real BIOS will improve compatibility, especially with
certain games and with theuse of memory cards.

See the 'doc/' folder in the source, or '/usr/share/doc/pcsx/' on Debian
systems, for more detailed information on PCSX-Reloaded.
A UNIX manpage is also available.
